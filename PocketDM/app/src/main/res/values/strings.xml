        There isn\'t much to do here just yet, but for now you can take full advantage of the
        feature that was the primary inspiration behind this app: Critical Hit and Fumble Tables.
        To use these when your characters roll a critical hit or fumble an attack just select
        the proper tables from the main menu, enter your percentile roll, then select the weapon
        being used or press "Go". The result of your roll will appear below.
